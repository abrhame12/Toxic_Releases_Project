# Emergency Room Visits Dashboard

## Objective
The objective of the project is to create an informative and user-friendly ER (Emergency Room) Visits Dashboard. The dashboard serves as a platform for analyzing data related to emergency room visits. It highlights some important metrics such as total visits, average wait times, and demographic details that hospital staff would find useful. The dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abrham.eshetu/viz/EmergencyRoomVisitsDashboardrwfdDataWizardry/Dashboard1)

## About The Dataset
The dataset was acquired from Data.world, and it includes patient information such as name, ID, wait times, department referral, and general demographic data. The data is fictional and was meant to replicate how a real hospital would input patient information. 


## Conclusion of Project
Upon finishing the project, here are some of my key findings.
1. The Average patient satisfaction score is 4.99/10
2. The Average wait time is about 35 mins.
3. On average, the day and time where the wait time is the highest is on Mondays at 11:00 pm
4. People who identify as white males visit the ER most frequently while Native American/ Alaskan males visit the ER less frequently.
