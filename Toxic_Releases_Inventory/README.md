# Toxic_Releases_Inventory

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide some key insights into the toxic chemical release habits of various facilities across the United States. This project looks at release trends from 2017 to 2021 and examines the release habits of states and industrial sectors in relation to one another. In this project, I organized and cleaned the data through Excel. After that, I answered some key questions by using SQL scripts and finally visualized my findings through Tableau which can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abrham.eshetu/viz/ToxicReleasesintheU_S_From2017to2021/Story1). 

## About The Dataset
The dataset was acquired from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and it includes toxic release details from 
various facilities across the United States. Each raw data set includes 119 columns which include facilities, facility ID, address, chemical identification, and many more. The raw data can be accessed [here](https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-data-files-calendar-years-1987-present#top). The datasets were cleaned, organized, and formatted so that they contained only key columns (29 to be exact) for the project. The cleaned dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/abrhame12/portfolio_projects/tree/main/Toxic_Releases_Inventory/data).


## SQL Scripts
The SQL code that I used to query and analyze my data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/abrhame12/portfolio_projects/tree/main/Toxic_Releases_Inventory/SQL).

## Conclusion of Project
Upon finishing the project, here are some of my key findings.
1. 52% of toxic materials released were isolated to Just 5 States which are Alaska, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Louisiana.
2. Total releases decreased from 2017 to 2020 however it looks like they are on an upward trend after 2020.
3. The metal mining industry is the top industry sector with the most toxic releases in the U.S.
4. Zinc Compounds are the most released chemical in the U.S. from 2017 to 2021 and are prevalent in the metal mining industry.
