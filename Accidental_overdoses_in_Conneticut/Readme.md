# Accidental Overdoses in Connecticut

## Objective
Opioid usage and opioid-related overdoses have become serious public health issues in the United States. My project particularly focuses on the opioid epidemic in the state of Connecticut. This Project explores accidental overdoses and drug-related deaths from 2012 to 2022. The purpose of this project was to provide insight into how this epidemic has affected certain demographics of people in conjunction with their geographic location within Connecticut. I was able to wrangle and analyze data from the past decade through Excel and SQL. Lastly, I visualized my findings in the form of a dashboard on Tableau Public. Check out my dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abrham.eshetu/viz/AccidentalDrugRelatedDeathsinConnecticut_16950028012660/Dashboard12)

## About The Dataset
The dataset was obtained from data.gov. It includes demographic information, date of death, geographical information, and the types of drugs present. The dataset was cleaned wrangled and analyzed [here](https://github.com/abrhame12/portfolio_projects/tree/main/Accidental_overdoses_in_Conneticut/data).


## SQL Scripts
The SQL code that I used to query and analyze my data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/abrhame12/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Accidental_overdoses_in_Conneticut/SQL/sql).

## Conclusion of Project
Here are some of my findings.
1. 74% of accidental overdose deaths were male. 
2. The white population was the most affected race by the opioid epidemic with 85% of deaths being attributed to that population.
3. Fentanyl was the most prevalent drug and it was present in over 6000 deaths in the past decade.
4. The number of accidental overdoses and drug-related deaths has been growing since 2012
5. Hartford and New Haven are among the top counties that have high reported deaths with almost 5000 deaths.
